      // so let start with for loop

      //   the function of a loop is to loop through aa section of code over and over again
      //   the opening and closing {} of a loop is known as code blocks
      //   the first code inside a for loops is known as initialization (let i = 0) it also known as counter; how many time we run a code
      //   the second code inside is a condition, it always evaluate to TRUE / FALSE if the condition is true we are going to run the code

      let names = ["oslim", "sam", "coll"];
      for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
        console.log(names[i]);
        // we can this process itration
        // each iteration is one circle throught
        // every time we perform  a code block in a loop is one iteration throught the data

      /* WHILE LOOPS */
      //   is same things as for looops you loop through some code at a certain amount of time, no diffrent, the only diffrent is the syntax

      //   example of for loops
      //   for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      //     // const element = array[i]z
      //   }
      // Example of while loop
      let i = 0;

        console.log("in loop:", name[i]);
